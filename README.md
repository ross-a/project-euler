This is a collection of my solutions to Project Euler problems. 
Most, if not all, solutions are done with Odin lang (https://odin-lang.org/) and sometimes raylib (https://www.raylib.com/).

Solutions are put in .org files, which I org-babel-tangle/detangle in Emacs (https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) when working on them.
